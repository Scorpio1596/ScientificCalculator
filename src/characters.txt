Elara is a bright-eyed 16-year-old villager with windswept auburn hair and a freckled face. Dressed in earth-toned tunics and worn boots, she moves like a shadow through the woods. Curious to a fault and driven by dreams of adventure, she possesses a rare instinct to sense things hidden or forgotten.
